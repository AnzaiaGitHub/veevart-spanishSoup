# veevart-spanishSoup
A Veevart logic test solution where you can input a matrix of characters and an array of Words and the Solution will log the position of the given words in the matrix or the "word not found".

You can open in the browser the [codepen](https://codepen.io/anzaiagithub/pen/OJoKQJd?editors=0011) and open the console window to see the results.

You can also make your own calls to the solution function with the (soupMatrix,wordList) arguments to see the results like the next example:
```JAVASCRIPT
const soupMatrix = [
    "L I S T O F",
    "P H R A S E",
    "A D J U S T",
    "T A C N O C",
    "H S O F T H",
];
const wordList = [
    "LIST",
    "PHRASE",
    "ADJUST",
    "SOFT",
    "PATH",
    "FETCH",
];

solution(soupMatrix,wordList);
```
then, check in the console for your solution output.
